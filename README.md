# Hey there! 👋 I'm Arnaud

I'm a budding developer with a passion for creating and a never-ending curiosity for the tech world. Every day, I’m diving deeper into code, building cool projects, and leveling up my skills—one commit at a time. Here’s a bit about me!

## 🌟 About Me
- 🚀 **Currently exploring:** Node.js with Anthony Alicea and Three.js with Bruno Simon
- 🧩 **Always curious about:** new inventions that can enhance human potential
- 🌱 **Goal for this year:** Build my first portfolio
- 📚 **Learning style:** Tea or chocolat, code, repeat! ☕💻
- 🎨 **Fun fact:** [Something quirky, like "I can solve a Rubik's cube in under a minute!" or "I have a playlist for debugging sessions"]
